* [22,27,16,2,18,6]

* Write the stages of the above given sequence according to the sort type.

  - [(2), 27 , 16 ,(22), 18 , 6 ]
  - [ 2 ,(6), 16 , 22 , 18 ,(27)]
  - [ 2 , 6 , 16 ,(18),(22), 27 ]


* Write the Big-O notation.

  - O( $n^2$ )

* Time Complexity: 

 > - Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle
 > - Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end
 > - Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.

* What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write.

  - The number 18 is in the middle of the list after the list is sorted. That's why, this is an average case.

* [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] write the first 4 steps according to the Insertion Sort.

  - [(2), 3 , 5 , 8 ,(7), 9 , 4 , 15 , 6 ]
  - [ 2 , 3 ,(4), 8 , 7 , 9 ,(5), 15 , 6 ]
  - [ 2 , 3 , 4 ,(5), 7 , 9 ,(8), 15 , 6 ]
  - [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ,(6), 9 , 8 , 15 ,(7)]
